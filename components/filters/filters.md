The filter components are **dispatching filtering criterias** to the store. Each filter element should be nested in the [FilterPanel](#filterpanel). Filter object is available from the store as `filters` rootkey and have subkeys accordingly to the filter components used. Filtering logic should be implemented in the presentational component using the `filters` object to conditionally render items based on the given criterias.
