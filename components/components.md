Components are designed to have single responsibility according to their role in the application structure. Business data is centralised in the Redux store (_store_ is always refers to the _Redux Store_) and individual parts communicate with each other by dispatching actions to modify the actual state.

These elemetns are composed by [Chakra-UI](https://chakra-ui.com) components. The original behaviour inherited the library which means its possible to pass [Style Props](https://chakra-ui.com/style-props) to any component.

> **_Definition_**
>
> _Style Props are a way to alter the style of a component by simply passing props to it. It helps to save time by providing helpful shorthand ways to style components._

For more information visit the [Style Props](https://chakra-ui.com/style-props) documentation.

Used **Elements** and **States** are presented in each component documentation to give brief description of the context.
